# django + docker cookiecutter

[pydanny/cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django) is the uncrowned king, obviously. But at times I need something more lightweight. That's how this cookiecutter came about.

## create project

- `cookiecutter git@github.com:creimers/django-docker-cookiecutter.git`

or

- `cookiecutter django-docker-cookiecutter`

This cookiecutter is the cousin of [creimers/djangocms-docker-cookiecutter](https://github.com/creimers/djangocms-docker-cookiecutter).
